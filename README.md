WEB PROGRAMMING CLASS PROJECT WEB SITE DESIGN WITH INTRODUCTION TO FORMULA 1 AND CURRENT NEWS ABOUT FORMULA 1

Hello, I am Necdet Can ÖZBEK. We were asked to design a website for our Web Programming class. Since I am interested in Formula 1 sport, I have determined the concept of the website I will design as Formula 1. On the website I will design, I aimed to inform people about Formula 1, as well as to share current news about Formula 1 and for the users of the site to comment on these news. I aimed to create an admin panel on the website I will design so that users with this authority can perform various actions. To begin with, I thought that users who are admins can add news to the site, edit existing news, add users, and prevent the user from accessing the site. In addition, I aimed to enable users to become members of the website I will design and to have their own profile pages. On this website that I will design, I aimed for people who are interested in Formula 1 to spend time, and I thought of doing my work in this direction. To summarize briefly, I planned that this website, which I am planning to build, should be in the concept of a news and a forum site. -Technologies I Will Use in the Project • Asp.net Core 3.1 Razor Pages • C# • SQL Server as Database /PostgreSQL/ etc. • Entity Framework Core ORM • Bootstrap Theme • HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and JQUERY
